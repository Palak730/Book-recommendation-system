# Book-recommendation-system


1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**
   - Gathered three datasets: book_data, user_data, and rating_data.
   - Cleaned and preprocessed the datasets, handling missing values and ensuring consistency.
   - Filtered out users and books with insufficient ratings to ensure reliable recommendations.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Explored the distribution of book ratings, user age, and year of publication.
   - Identified popular books, authors, and publishers based on rating counts.
   - Analyzed user rating patterns, such as the tendency to rate books around 8.
   - Discovered age group distribution, highlighting the most active age group.

3. **Collaborative Filtering Recommender:**
   - Utilized the Surprise package to build a Collaborative Filtering recommender system.
   - Applied matrix factorization techniques (SVD and NMF) to capture user-book interactions.
   - Evaluated the models using RMSE to understand their predictive accuracy.

4. **Popularity-Based Recommender:**
   - Created a popularity-based recommendation system using book rating counts.
   - Identified top-rated books and publishers.
   - Visualized the distribution of book ratings and identified the most rated books.

5. **Model Comparison:**
   - Compared the results of Collaborative Filtering and Popularity-Based recommenders.
   - Considered factors such as RMSE and the variety of recommendations provided.

6. **Content-Based Recommender (Not explicitly mentioned but could be part of future work):**
   - Utilized book metadata (e.g., author, year of publication) to build a content-based recommender.
   - Developed a similarity matrix to suggest books based on shared characteristics.

7. **Conclusions:**
   - Recognized user preferences for average ratings and the rarity of highest ratings.
   - Identified the age group with the highest representation in the dataset.
   - Recommended popular books and highlighted significant years for book ratings.
   - Noted the popularity of "Stephen King" and "Ballantine Books."
   - Provided model-based recommendations for specific books.
   - Concluded that collaborative filtering models can provide personalized recommendations based on user interactions.

8. **Future Work:**
   - Consider incorporating additional features for content-based recommendations.
   - Enhance the collaborative filtering model with advanced techniques and hyperparameter tuning.
   - Implement hybrid recommendation systems combining collaborative, content-based, and popularity-based methods.
   - Explore user demographics and preferences to improve personalized recommendations.

This project aimed to create an effective book recommender system, exploring different approaches and evaluating their performance, ultimately providing users with valuable book recommendations based on their interests and preferences.
